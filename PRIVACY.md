# Privacy Policy for Zettel

_Last updated: July 22, 2025_

## Overview

Zettel is a minimalist iOS note-taking app designed with privacy as a core principle. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

Zettel operates entirely on your device and does not:

- Collect personal information
- Track user behavior
- Send data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Access your contacts, location, or other personal data beyond what's necessary for the app's functionality

## Data Storage

All your notes and app data are stored locally on your device:

- Notes are saved as Markdown files in your chosen directory (default: Documents/)
- App settings and preferences are stored locally using iOS's standard UserDefaults
- No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties

## File Access

Zettel only accesses:

- The storage directory you select for saving your notes
- Standard iOS file system APIs to read and write Markdown files
- This access is limited to the functionality of creating, editing, and organizing your notes

## Third-Party Services

Zettel does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## iCloud and File Sharing

If you choose to store your notes in an iCloud-enabled directory:

- Your notes may be synchronized with your other Apple devices through iCloud
- This synchronization is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service
- We do not have access to this data during synchronization
- Apple's privacy policy governs iCloud data handling

## Data Security

Your notes remain under your complete control:

- All data processing happens locally on your device
- You can export your notes at any time through the iOS Files app
- You can delete all app data by deleting the app or clearing its data

## Children's Privacy

Zettel does not collect any data from users of any age. The app is safe for users of all ages as it operates entirely offline and locally.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this document. Since the app doesn't collect data or communicate with external servers, significant changes to our privacy practices are unlikely.

- You can export or delete your notes at any time through the iOS Files app

This privacy policy reflects our commitment to building a truly private, local-first note-taking experience.
